Array Generation: The visualizer allows users to generate a random array of a specified size. The generateArray function creates an array with random integer values within a given range.

State Management: The visualizer uses React's state hook (useState) to manage the array state. The array state variable holds the current state of the array.

Merge Sort Algorithm: The mergeSort function implements the merge sort algorithm. It recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays until they have a length of 1. Then, it merges and sorts the subarrays to form the sorted final array.

Visualization: The visualizer provides a graphical representation of the sorting process. This can be achieved using CSS or other visual effects libraries in combination with React's rendering capabilities.

Animation and Delay: To visualize the sorting process step by step, animation and delay mechanisms can be implemented. This allows users to see how the array elements are compared, swapped, and merged during the sorting algorithm.

User Interface: The visualizer may include a user interface with buttons or sliders to control the array size, start or reset the sorting process, and adjust the speed of the visualization.

React Components: The visualizer can be built using multiple React components to organize the code and separate concerns. For example, there could be a component for the array visualization, another for the control panel, and so on.

Responsive Design: The visualizer should be designed to be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a good user experience across various platforms.

Error Handling: The visualizer can include error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input, such as negative array sizes or incorrect data types.

Code Structure and Modularity: The visualizer code should follow best practices for code structure, modularity, and maintainability. It can be organized into reusable functions and components to make the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
